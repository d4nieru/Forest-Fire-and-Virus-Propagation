# About

This was a school project on a Forest Fire and Virus Propagation Simulation. The initial functions were already written and we had to complete and improve the program.

# Required software

**•** An IDE for the Python language.

# Installation

Here are the values of the variables that you can easily change for both programs.

# For the Forest Fire

`N      = 50` by default →→ Size of the square board

`size(600, 600)` →→ Size of the program window (e.g. 600x600)

`frameRate(10)` →→ the draw() loop will be called x times per second

`fabrique_la_foret(0.425,0.1)` →→ Used to make a nice forest

`met_le_feu(1)` →→ Used to light several fireplaces

`la_foudre_c_cool(0)` →→ Number of lightning strikes

# For the Virus Propagation

`N      = 50` by default →→ Size of the square board

`taux_contamination = 0.4` →→ Contamination_rate

`taux_porteur_sains = 0.05` →→ Healthy_carrier_rate

`mortalite = 0.02` →→ Mortality

`taux_immunise = 0.01` →→ Rate_immunized

`size(600, 600)` →→ Size of the program window (e.g. 600x600)

`frameRate(5)` →→ the draw() loop will be called x times per second

`fallout(1)` →→ Used to light several fireplaces (yes.. we were very creative for the name of the variable :v)
